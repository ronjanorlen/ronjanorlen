## Hello!

My name is Ronja and I live in Ã…re, Sweden. I'm a university student on my way to become a web developer!  
I have not been programming alot before, only a tiny bit in HTML when I was younger.  

We are currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I'm excited to be able to code some cool things in the future.
